The parseFloat() function parses a string and returns a floating point number.
This function determines if the first character in the specified string is a number. If it is, it parses the string until it reaches the end of the number, and returns the number as a number, not as a string.
Note: Only the first number in the string is returned!
Note: Leading and trailing spaces are allowed.
Note: If the first character cannot be converted to a number, parseFloat() returns NaN.

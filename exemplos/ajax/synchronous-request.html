    /*
      Synchronous Request:
      To execute a synchronous request, change the third parameter
      in the open() method to false:
      xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", false);

      Sometimes async = false are used for quick testing. You will also
      find synchronous requests in older JavaScript code.
      Since the code will wait for server completion, there is
      no need for an onreadystatechange function:

      Synchronous XMLHttpRequest (async = false) is not recommended because the JavaScript will stop executing until the server response is ready. If the server is busy or slow, the application will hang or stop.
      Synchronous XMLHttpRequest is in the process of being removed from the web standard, but this process can take many years.
      Modern developer tools are encouraged to warn about using synchronous requests and may throw an InvalidAccessError exception when it occurs.


      Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because
      of its detrimental effects to the end userâ€™s
      experience. For more help http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/
